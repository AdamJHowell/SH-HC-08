# SH-HC-08
A simple Arduino driver for the SH-HC-08 Bluetooth module.  This will also work with the SH-M08.

This is configured for the Arduino Uno, but should be easy to modify for other boards.

Connect the TX of the module to the RX on the Arduino, and the RX of the module to the TX of the Arduino.
